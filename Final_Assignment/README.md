This project was a process of series of assignments mentioned below.<br/>
1. Parsing the Data<br/>
Initially I parsed the data from 10 different pages containing the AA meetings for different zones in New York. An example of parsing one of the page can be seen [here.](https://github.com/salonieshah/data-structures/tree/master/Week01) I followed the same process to parse all the pages.<br/>
2.Cleaning the Data<br/>
The parsed data was inconsistent and difficult to manipulate. Hence, I decided to clean the data and create a json for all the cleaned addresses and meetings. An example of parsing one of the page can be seen [here.](https://github.com/salonieshah/data-structures/tree/master/Week02)
