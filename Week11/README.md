1. The interface sketches intend to map the AA json file to an interactive map. </br>
2. Each circle on the map refers to one location. The map can be zoomed in or zoomed out. When the viewer clicks on the circle, the viewer can know all the meetings at particular location. </br>
3. The user can also find the meeting using the filters on the right side. </br>
4. The data needs to be filtered on the basis of address, zone, meeting day, meeting time, and accessibility. </br>
5. Sketch 1 would be the defalt view. </br>
6. I have made an assumption that the user understands the standard symbols for zoom in , zoom out, and is using a computer or laptop due to screen proportion of interface design and function of hoverover.</br><br/>

1. The interface sketches intend to map the live Postgres table to an interactive visualization. </br>
2. Each circle in the visualization refers to hourly temperature data. </br>
3. The user can understand and filter the data using legend on the bottom</br>
4. The data can to be filtered on the basis of temperature location, time and intensity. </br>
5. Sketch 1 would be the defalt view. </br>
6. I have made an assumption that the user is using a computer or laptop due to screen proportion of interface design. </br><br/>

1. The interface sketches intend to map the dynamo db table to a blog page. </br>
2. Each square is one blog entry. </br>
3. The user can understand and filter the data by using the icon on top right. </br>
4. The data can to be filtered on the basis of category and time. </br>
5. Sketch 1 would be the defalt view. </br>
6. I have made an assumption that the user is using a computer or laptop due to screen proportion of interface design.</br><br/>
